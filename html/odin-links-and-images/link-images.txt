HTML LINKS AND IMAGES 

1.Anchor Elements(<a> tag)

 ->to create a link in html,we use the anchor element
 ->use like this:<a> click me </a>
 -><a href="links">click me</a>

2.Absolute and Relative Links

  1. Links to pages on other websites on the internet
  2. Links to pages located on our own websites

  * ABSOLUTE LINK
  
  ->Links to pages on other websites on the internet are called absolute links

  * RELATIVE LINKS

  ->Links to other pages within our own website are called relative links

  // IMPORTANT //

  *  A Metaphor:

           Absolute and relative links are a tricky concept to build a good mental model of, a metaphor may help:

           Think of your domain name (town.com) as a town, the directory in which your website 
           is located (/museum) as a museum, and each page on your website as a room in
           the museum (/museum/movie_room.html and /museum/shops/coffee_shop.html).
           Relative links like ./shops/coffee_shop.html are directions from the current room 
           (the museum movie room /museum/movie_room.html) to another room (the museum shop).
           Absolute links, on the other hand, are full directions including the protocol (https),
           domain name (town.com) and the path from that domain name 
           (/museum/shops/coffee_shop.html): https://town.com/museum/shops/coffee_shop.html.

3.Images(<images> tag)

 ->To display an image in HTML we use the <img> element
 -> like this :<img src="" alt="">
 ->parent directories
    relative filepath like this:(../)
    <img src="../images/dog.jpg">
 ->alt attributes.
